# Pokemon-Data-Analysis-
Pokemon data analysis project 
A small data analysis project on pokemon from generations 1 to 6.

my first data analysis project 
The project contains looking at certain pokemon types that have unique typing and 
will use pandas, seaborn, matplotlib to make a graph about certain stats that are high for a specific type


why this project is useful is because by looking at the graphs and stats we can see which pokemon has a high stat and can take advantage of this
in competitive battling for pokemon held tournaments.
